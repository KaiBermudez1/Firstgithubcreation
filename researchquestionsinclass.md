My research question (at the current moment): How can Ethiopia best help itself to provide clean, safe water for its people?
I would say that my research question is, in my mind, a mix of evaluative and explanatory. To understand how Ethiopia can best help itself, you have to understand why they have a lack of water (explanatory), and then look at how it is trying to help itself through installing more wells, and evaluate (evaluative) whether this practice is effective. Internally I almost feel as though I want to solve the problem itself and help hundreds of thousands of people. However, since I lack the experience and the capital, I have to instead explain why water is almost disappearing from the country (mostly due to climate change giving the country less rainfall), based on research I have conducted. When you narrow down a problem to its roots, you can think about how to best solve it. It seems as though Ethiopia has had to focus their efforts on wells and groundwater. According to thewaterproject.org, Ethiopia used to be able to get water from the Nile in Colonial times, but their population growth is expanding vastly and has become one reason why water is becoming more scarce from person to person. 
From these problems, two sub research questions can be established. First, What is the most pertinent cause of water scarcity in Ethoipia? Second, What should be done about this issue based on similar situations and results in nearby countries?
